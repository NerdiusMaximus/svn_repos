End of the day commit. The basic GUI works but the main things remaining to do are thus:

Figure out how to share data between all of the callbacks efficiently

Look for all the data to be entered somehow to trigger activation of the Choose Output Directory button, which when completed will activate the Parse Transformations Data button

figure out how to plot a small preview of the meshes in the preview plot windows without crashing the computer.

*****************************
Correct Transformation Math!!
*****************************

Export Function to add all the directories and put the stl meshes in there

Need to also filter data from teh start to delete any rows containing zeros in camera data

Need to also figure out how to import the load cell data (not critical)

Dialog box to tell the user what data is being processed as transforms are going on

dialog box to pop up with either plot or a dialog to say the stuff has finished and is ready

Much to do...
